Pokemon Memory Game is a Heroku hosted memory game.  It utilizes React.js to render the page.  Once the virtual DOM is rendered it includes 12 images that are randomized each time a card is clicked.  To begin the game simply click on any image.  Be careful to remember what you clicked!  Clicking an image twice will reset the game!  Have fun!
